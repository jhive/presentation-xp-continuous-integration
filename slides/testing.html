<h1 style="font-size:2em">Testing</h1>
<h4 class="fragment">If the interface for a method is at all unclear, you write a test before you right the method</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">If the interface is clear, but you imagine that the implementation will be the least bit complicated, you write a test before you write the method</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">If you think of an unusual circumstance in which the code should work as written, you write a test to communicate the circumstance</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">If you find a problem later, you write a test that isolates the problem</h4>
<h4 class="fragment">If you are about to refactor some code, and you aren't sure how it's supposed to behave, and there isn't already a test for the aspect of the behaviour in question, you write a test first</h4>
