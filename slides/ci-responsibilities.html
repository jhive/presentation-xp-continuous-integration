  <h3 class="fragment">Check in frequently</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Create a habit of smaller commits and integrations: daily, hourly, on the minute</p>
  <h3 class="fragment">Don't check in broken code</h3>
  <p class="fragment">and if you do, everyone stops to fix it</p>
  <h3 class="fragment">Don't check in untested code</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Code that isn't tested, is code that doesn't exist</p>
  <h3 class="fragment">Don't check in when the build is broken</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Even better: Don't write code while the build is broken</p>
  <h3 class="fragment">Don't go home after checking in until the build is tested</h3>
  <p class="fragment">Just wait until you're refreshed in the morning</p>
